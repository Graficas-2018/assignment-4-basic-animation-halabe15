# A3 Basic Animation

Assignment No 4 for the computer graphics course. 

Based on the threejs Shadow demo, create an animation for an object loaded from an OBJ or JSON file. The object must rotate as if walking around a circle. It must face the direction it is walking.

Rubric:

1. Loaded an OBJ or JSON model.
2. Define the keyframe animations needed.
3. Apply the animations to the correct attributes of the model.
4. The object is animated as if it was walking.

**NOTES**
1. The model is not moving as expected: it is not moving in a circle, but in a square.
2. The rotation of the model is missing.
